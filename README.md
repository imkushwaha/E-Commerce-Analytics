# E-Commerce Analytics
DATA SCIENCE PRODEGREE PROJECT

## Market Outlook-
E-commerce stores which became success stories were successful in targeting the desired customers. One of the techniques by which they were able to achieve this was customer segmentation i.e. by segmenting the existing customers based on frequency of purchases, monetary value etc. E-commerce stores who designed market strategies based on mass marketing soon realized the need of customer segmentation as an alternative to save cost and efforts in the digital sphere. In a real-world segmentation scenario, there might be hundreds of variables which can be used but broadly they segment the customers by the following characteristics: 
- Geographic - Segments based on country, state, and city. 
- Demographic - Segments based on gender, age, income, education level, etc. 
- Psychographic - Segments based on geography, lifestyle, age and religious beliefs, etc. 
- Behavior - Segments based on consumer personality traits, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles.
